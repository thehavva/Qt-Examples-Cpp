**What is Qt**<br/>
*Qt is a graphical user interface development toolkit that supports multiple platforms. Although it is generally used to develop GUI programs, its advanced library includes many tools besides GUI components. Qt is best known for its use in the KDE desktop environment, the Opera web browser, and Skype instant messengers.

*Although Qt uses C++, it can also be used with Python, Ruby, PHP, Perl, Pascal, C# and Java thanks to its links to different languages.

*Qt, which is distributed as a Software Development Kit, comes with many sample applications when installed. Thanks to the new Integrated Development Environment, Qt Creator, the development process has been greatly accelerated.

**Aim**<br/>
*Qt Group (Nasdaq Helsinki: QTCOM) is a global software company with a strong presence in more than 70 industries and is the leading independent technology behind millions of devices and applications. Qt is used by major global companies and developers worldwide, and the technology enables its customers to deliver exceptional user experiences and advance their digital transformation initiatives. Qt achieves this through its cross-platform software framework for the development of apps and devices, under both commercial and open source licenses.

*Qt technology is used by approximately one million developers worldwide. We enable a single software code across all operating systems, platforms and screen types, from desktops and embedded systems to business-critical applications, in-vehicle systems, wearables and mobile devices connected to the Internet of Things.

*The company's net sales in year 2020 totaled 79.5 MEUR and it employs over 400 people. The Qt Group operates in China, Finland, Germany, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Russia, the USA, France, UK, Italy and India.

*Code less. Create more. Deploy everywhere.

*I met Qt through a friend of mine. Although it was very argumentative and complex at first, I decided to develop cpp with qt after researching it in detail and looking at what I could do. It especially attracted my attention with its colorful features that allow the codes we write to come alive in 2 dimensions. I will share all the programs and projects that I have done, starting from the very basics.If you want to deal with qt creater, you can download qt creater from this [google link](https://www.qt.io/) website and start your work. Do not forget to make the right choices according to the characteristics of your computer and operating system.*
